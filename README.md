EmulationStation Launcher for Kodi
==================================

CHANGELOG:
==========

**Version 1.0.1**
- Added 'Quit KODI before launching EmulationStation' option which quits Kodi before launching EmulationStation

**Version 1.0.0**
- Added 'Disable Exit Menu in EmulationStation' option which will disable the exit option within EmulationStation.



NOTES:
======

- Only tested with KODI v17 (Krypton) and Ubuntu Linux 16.04.
- Don't blame me if this shit don't work for you, but it did the trick for me.



Thanks to Stephen Thirlwall for his original idea and code.
